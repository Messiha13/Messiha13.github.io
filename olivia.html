<p>
I was born in Chicago IL, and was given the name Olivia from my aunt as a baby.  
She said my name meant a beautiful wonderful young woman.  Maybe that’s why I know my values and what I possess. 
I came into Year up not really sure of what I wanted to do.  All I really knew was that I was creative and I had prior experience with webpages. 
This program to me is deemed a success, not only have I learned but I have grown. Life was just a box of chocolates to me, always different but with the same exterior which would be my skin. I now consider my passion to be coding.

I love the creative side of things adding the colors, changing the text and making everything appealing to the eye. I remember as a little girl my grandma would ask me to help her do simple troubleshooting activities on her computer that back then I probably didn’t know what I was doing but I was willing to try. 
I helped my grandma with everything from restarting the computer to just writing her word documents. I guess you can say I started at a young age, helping my grandma and then moving into high school joining Business Professionals of America and finding what I now consider my passion. I realized after high school that maybe college wasn’t for me, but after joining Year up I know that it is my ticket to success, although I consider certifications helpful,  I want a degree for me not for anyone else.
To know that I accomplished something on my own to better myself.  Its amazing people wouldn’t even grasp my excitement just talking about it.
