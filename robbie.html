<p>I am currently a student at Year up Chicago focusing on the development of my software and hardware skills. Year Up is a one-year intensive professional brand building workforce development training program that focuses on giving young adults the skills and knowledge to become successful business professionals. 
We are trained in various fields IT such as software, hardware, cyber security, and programming. We also have courses in finance, project management, and general business etiquette skills. I came into this program with minimal experience in IT.</p>

<p>My background is in English and poetry. My goal is to use my experience at year up to create a curriculum that incorporates technology and the arts so I can open up a resource center in the community of south shore. 
Poetry and language are things that are very important to me and growing up it was something that helped me get through the hard times in my life. I understand how important it is for youth to have exposure to new technologies and to understand how to utilize technology to advance their lives. I also understand how important it is for young adults to have a voice and I want to be able to provide my community with a platform to nurture the young people who need the resources to guide their success. '
In my free time I enjoy writing, watching anime, gaming, and trying out new restaurants. Feel free to connect with me on linked in.</p>
