<p>Hello citizens. My name is Jawon Willis. I am in my early 20’s and am always in the pursuit of knowledge.  Speaking of the pursuit of knowledge, I am currently in an IT and business professional program called Year Up. The skills I have obtained while learning and developing from this program are hardware skills, software skills, web development skills and business professional skills. On my down time, I write poetry, 
play video games and do various outdoor activities i.e. Bike riding, traveling, swimming, etc. 
My present goal is to work on earning my CompTIA+ certification so I can assure my position as a Help Desk Technician. Why I chose this position you ask? Well, beforehand I wanted to do Cyber Security but since that is a field of its own and also since I was not chosen to continue forward into that particular field, I chose the next best thing. From then on, I know that I have to work from the bottom up. 
</p>
<p>If I get my hands on all kinds of knowledge before I delve into the more complicating fields, I will have no difficulties later on. I believe in hard work and very little shortcuts can lead to a healthy work ethic and a bright future.
Even though I have a heavy pursuit of knowledge on a daily basis, I do believe in resting and having some “me time” is essential to a healthy lifestyle and a stress reliever so you won’t feel exhausted. How I carry out the relaxation time varies from what I feel like doing.</p>

<p>The most common one is playing video games. Yes I know, you are probably thinking, “That is unproductive” or something along the lines of that but actually, one thing I forgot to mention is that I work with a company called IPG (I Play Games) and yes, not only do we play games, but we also promote business professionality as well as promoting great customer service by providing an area for people to come play the most current games as well as interact with people in a kindly manner.
I also write poetry when I have my moments of feeling and thinking in unison. Finally, the last relaxing activity I enjoy doing is going out on an adventure. Like I said above, I like to travel and do outside physical activities to not only work towards being healthy, but also stay healthy. 
Thank you for taking the time to actively engage in reading my bios. There is a lot more about me so feel free to contact me at any time for more questions and thoughts.</p>
